To verify the correctness of my program, I run extensive test cases.
First I run the tests cases given by the TA. The output of the test cases are:

cse misc/zzhang> ./DNS_Resolver www.cse.unl.edu
Parsed CNAME address in Answer section is: cse.unl.edu.
Parsed IPv4 address is: 129.93.165.2

cse misc/zzhang> ./DNS_Resolver google.com
Parsed IPv4 address is: 74.125.225.78
Parsed IPv4 address is: 74.125.225.72

cse misc/zzhang> ./DNS_Resolver www.cam.ac.uk

cse misc/zzhang> ./DNS_Resolver cmd.unl
Could not find the IP address for the hostname.

cse misc/zzhang> ./DNS_Resolver www.imdb.com
Parsed CNAME address in Answer section is: us.dd.imdb.com.
Parsed IPv4 address is: 72.21.203.211

cse misc/zzhang> ./DNS_Resolver www.lincoln.ne.gov
Parsed CNAME address in Answer section is: interlinc.lincoln.ne.gov.
Parsed IPv4 address is: 199.48.10.69

I verify the result of my program by comparing it with the result derived by using 'dig'. All the test cases are successfully passed. They derived the same results as using 'dig'.

I also run several other test cases, trying to cover as many different kinds of hostnames as possible.

cse misc/zzhang> ./DNS_Resolver www.163.com
Parsed CNAME address in Answer section is: www.cache.wangsu.netease.com.
Parsed CNAME address in Answer section is: www.163.com.lxdns.com.

cse misc/zzhang> ./DNS_Resolver www.youku.com

Parsed IPv4 address is: 211.151.146.209

cse misc/zzhang> ./DNS_Resolver www.mit.edu
Parsed IPv4 address is: 18.9.22.169



To my best knowledge, for the test cases I have run, I didn't find in any situations for any valid hostnames that the DNS resolver cannot resolve.
